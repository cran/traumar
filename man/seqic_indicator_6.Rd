\title{SEQIC Indicator 6 - Delayed Arrival Following Low GCS}
\usage{
seqic_indicator_6(
  data,
  level,
  included_levels = c("I", "II", "III", "IV"),
  unique_incident_id,
  transfer_out_indicator,
  receiving_indicator,
  low_GCS_indicator,
  time_from_injury_to_arrival,
  groups = NULL,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing trauma incident records.}

\item{level}{Column indicating the trauma center designation level (e.g., I,
II, III, IV).}

\item{included_levels}{Character vector indicating what facility levels to
include in the analysis.  Defaults to \code{c("I", "II", "III", "IV")}.}

\item{unique_incident_id}{Unique identifier for each record.}

\item{transfer_out_indicator}{Column name indicating whether the patient was
transferred out of the initial trauma center to definitive care. Logical,
character, or factor type. Values representing "No" (e.g., FALSE, "No")
indicate no transfer out.}

\item{receiving_indicator}{Column name indicating whether the
patient was transferred into the trauma center. Logical, character, or
factor type. Values representing "Yes" (e.g., TRUE, "Yes") indicate
transfer in.}

\item{low_GCS_indicator}{Column name for identifying patients with a
Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 9. Logical, character, or factor type.}

\item{time_from_injury_to_arrival}{Column name representing the time
in minutes from injury occurrence to arrival at the trauma center. Numeric
type.}

\item{groups}{Additional columns passed as a vector of strings to
\code{dplyr::summarize()} via the \code{.by} argument for grouped summaries. Defaults
to \code{NULL}.}

\item{calculate_ci}{If \code{NULL}, 95\% confidence intervals will not be
calculated for the performance estimates.  Otherwise, options of "wilson"
or "clopper-pearson" can be supplied to utilize the corresponding methods
to calculate the confidence intervals for the proportions. Defaults to
\code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[nemsqar:nemsqa_binomial_confint]{nemsqar::nemsqa_binomial_confint}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{conf.level}}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence
level. Defaults to 0.95 (95\% confidence interval).}
    \item{\code{correct}}{Logical, indicating whether to apply continuity correction for
Wilson intervals. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
  }}
}
\value{
A tibble summarizing SEQIC Indicator 6 results. Includes numerator,
denominator, calculated proportion, and optionally 95\% confidence
intervals.

Computes SEQIC Indicator 6 for trauma system quality monitoring. This
indicator measures the proportion of patients presenting with a Glasgow Coma
Scale (GCS) score < 9 who arrive at a trauma level I–IV center more than 180
minutes after injury. It excludes patients transferred out of the facility
and focuses on those transferred into a facility.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
\item Filters to trauma center records from facilities at trauma levels
I–IV.
\item Deduplicates records using \code{unique_incident_id}.
\item Calculates:
\itemize{
\item {Numerator:} Patients with low GCS (< 9) who arrived more than
180 minutes after injury, were transferred in, and not transferred
out.
\item {Denominator:} All patients with low GCS (< 9) who were
transferred in and not transferred out.
}
\item Optionally calculates Wilson or Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals
for the resulting proportion if \code{calculate_ci} is specified.
}
}
\note{
Users must ensure input columns are appropriately coded and standardized.
Transfer and GCS indicators should use consistent logical or textual
representations.
