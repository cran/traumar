\title{SEQIC Indicator 1 – Trauma Team Response Evaluation}
\usage{
seqic_indicator_1(
  data,
  trauma_team_activation_level,
  trauma_team_physician_service_type,
  level,
  included_levels = c("I", "II", "III", "IV"),
  unique_incident_id,

  groups = NULL,
  calculate_ci = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing trauma incident records.}

\item{trauma_team_activation_level}{Column identifying trauma team activation
level (e.g., Level 1, Level 2).}

\item{trauma_team_physician_service_type}{Column indicating the type of
medical provider (e.g., Surgery/Trauma, Emergency Medicine). For indicators
1a, 1b, and 1c, \code{seqic_indicator_1()} will only look for records with the
trauma team member service type documented as marked as 'Surgery/Trauma'.
For Indicators 1d, 1e, and 1f, \code{seqic_indicator_1()} will look for the
following service types:
\itemize{
\item "Surgery/Trauma",
\item "Emergency Medicine",
\item "Family Practice",
\item "Nurse Practitioner",
\item "Physician Assistant",
\item "Surgery Senior Resident",
\item "Hospitalist",
\item "Internal Medicine"
}}

\item{level}{Column indicating the trauma center designation level (e.g., I,
II, III, IV).}

\item{included_levels}{Character vector indicating what facility levels to
include in the analysis.  Defaults to \code{c("I", "II", "III", "IV")}.}

\item{unique_incident_id}{Unique identifier for each record.}

\item{response_time}{Numeric variable representing the time (in minutes)
to provider response.}

\item{trauma_team_activation_provider}{Column identifying the responding
provider for trauma activation.}

\item{groups}{Additional columns passed as a vector of strings to
\code{dplyr::summarize()} via the \code{.by} argument for grouped summaries. Defaults
to \code{NULL}.}

\item{calculate_ci}{If \code{NULL}, 95\% confidence intervals will not be
calculated for the performance estimates.  Otherwise, options of "wilson"
or "clopper-pearson" can be supplied to utilize the corresponding methods
to calculate the confidence intervals for the proportions. Defaults to
\code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[nemsqar:nemsqa_binomial_confint]{nemsqar::nemsqa_binomial_confint}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{conf.level}}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence
level. Defaults to 0.95 (95\% confidence interval).}
    \item{\code{correct}}{Logical, indicating whether to apply continuity correction for
Wilson intervals. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
  }}
}
\value{
A tibble summarizing SEQIC Indicator 1 results across sub-measures
(1a–1f). Includes numerators, denominators, and performance rate for each
indicator. 95\% confidence intervals are provided optionally.

This function calculates System Evaluation and Quality Improvement Committee
(SEQIC) Indicator 1 (subparts a through f). These indicators assess the
timeliness and type of provider response (e.g., surgeon, mid-level, physician)
to trauma alerts based on trauma team activation level, hospital trauma
level, and time to provider presence. Confidence intervals can optionally be
calculated for the proportion, using either the Wilson or Clopper-Pearson
method.
}
\details{
This function filters and summarizes trauma records to calculate
SEQIC Indicators 1a through 1f:
\itemize{
\item 1a: Proportion of Level 1 activations at Level I/II centers with
surgical response <= 15 minutes.
\item 1b: Same as 1a, but includes Level III centers and uses <= 30 minutes.
\item 1c: Proportion of Level 1 activations with missing surgical response
time.
\item 1d/e: Response within 5 and 20 minutes, respectively, for specific
provider types and activation levels, includes level I-IV trauma centers.
\item 1f: Proportion of missing response times among the group in 1d/e,
includes level I-IV trauma centers.
}
}
\note{
This function:
\itemize{
\item Filters trauma records to those with a trauma team activation level
of "Level 1" and/or "Level 2" based on the indicator.
\item Restricts provider type to surgical, physician, and mid-level
provider roles.
\item Filters trauma center levels to I–IV based on the measure.
\item Calculates the proportion of cases where the response time is within
5, 15, or 30 minutes, depending on the indicator.
\item Computes proportions for trauma activation times, including missing
times and within thresholds.

Users must ensure appropriate column names are passed and data is
pre-processed to include the necessary fields without missing critical
identifiers or timestamps.
