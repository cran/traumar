Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) and Process Improvement (PI) are
essential pillars of healthcare, particularly in the care of injured
patients. However, hospitals, trauma systems, and their trauma program
managers (TPMs) often lack access to standardized quality measures
derived from academic literature. The {traumar} package addresses this
gap by providing tools to calculate quality measures related to relative
mortality efficiently and accurately. By automating these calculations,
{traumar} empowers hospital systems, trauma networks, and TPMs to focus
their efforts on analyzing outcomes and driving meaningful improvements
in patient care. Whether you’re seeking to enhance PI initiatives or
streamline CQI processes, {traumar} serves as a valuable resource for
advancing trauma care quality.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `traumar` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/bemts-hhs/traumar) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bemts-hhs/traumar")
```

Additionally, you can install the CRAN version of `traumar` via:

``` r
install.packages("traumar")
```

## Helper Functions

{traumar} has many functions to help you in your data analysis journey!
In particular, if you do not presently have access to probability of
survival data, {traumar} provides the `probability_of_survival()`
function to do just that using the TRISS method. Check out the
additional package documentation at
<https://bemts-hhs.github.io/traumar/> where you can find examples of
each function the package has to offer.

## Calculating the W-Score

The W-Score tells us how many survivals (or deaths) on average out of
every 100 cases seen in a trauma center. Using R, we can do this with
the {traumar} package.

### First, we will create the data for these examples

``` r

# Generate example data with high negative skewness
set.seed(123)

# Parameters
n_patients <- 10000  # Total number of patients

# Generate survival probabilities (Ps) using a logistic distribution
Ps <- plogis(rnorm(n_patients, mean = 2, sd = 1.5))  # Skewed towards higher values

# Simulate survival outcomes based on Ps
survival_outcomes <- rbinom(n_patients, size = 1, prob = Ps)

# Create data frame
data <- data.frame(Ps = Ps, survival = survival_outcomes) |>
dplyr::mutate(death = dplyr::if_else(survival == 1, 0, 1))
```

### The W-Score!

``` r

# Calculate trauma performance (W, M, Z scores)
trauma_performance(data, Ps_col = Ps, outcome_col = death)
#> # A tibble: 9 × 2
#>   Calculation_Name        Value
#>   <chr>                   <dbl>
#> 1 N_Patients          10000    
#> 2 N_Survivors          8137    
#> 3 N_Deaths             1863    
#> 4 Predicted_Survivors  8097.   
#> 5 Predicted_Deaths     1903.   
#> 6 Patient_Estimate       40.3  
#> 7 W_Score                 0.403
#> 8 M_Score                 0.374
#> 9 Z_Score                 1.18
```

## Comparing the Probability of Survival Distribution of your Patient Mix to the [Major Trauma Outcomes Study](https://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/Abstract/1990/11000/The_Major_Trauma_Outcome_Study__Establishing.8.aspx)

The M and Z scores are calculated using methods defined in the
[literature](https://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/abstract/1978/10000/a_method_for_comparing_survival_of_burn_patients.3.aspx)
may not be meaningful if your the distribution of the probability of
survival measure is not similar enough to the Major Trauma Outcomes
Study distribution. {traumar} provides a way to check this in your data
analysis script, or even from the console. The `trauma_performance()`
function does this under the hood for you, so you can get a read out of
how much confidence you can put into the Z score.

``` r

# Compare the current case mix with the MTOS case mix
trauma_case_mix(data, Ps_col = Ps, outcome_col = death)
#>      Ps_range current_fraction MTOS_distribution
#> 1 0.00 - 0.25           0.0209             0.010
#> 2 0.26 - 0.50           0.0742             0.043
#> 3 0.51 - 0.75           0.1907             0.000
#> 4 0.76 - 0.90           0.3000             0.052
#> 5 0.91 - 0.95           0.1979             0.053
#> 6 0.96 - 1.00           0.2163             0.842
```

## The Relative Mortality Metric

Napoli et al.(2017) published methods for calculating a measure of
trauma center (or system) performance while overcoming a problem with
the W-Score and the TRISS methodology. Given that the majority of
patients seen at trauma centers will have a probability of survival over
90%, estimating performance based on the W-Score may only indicate how
well a center performed with lower acuity patients. Using Napoli et
al. (2017), it is possible to calculate a score that is similar to the
W-Score in its interpretability, but deals with the negatively skewed
probability of survival problem by creating non-linear bins of score
ranges, and then weighting a score based on the nature of those bins.
The Relative Mortality Metric (RMM) has a scale from -1 to 1.

- An RMM of 0 indicates that the observed mortality aligns with the
  expected national benchmark across all acuity levels.
- An RMM greater than 0 indicates better-than-expected performance,
  where the center is outperforming the national benchmark.
- An RMM less than 0 indicates under-performance, where the center’s
  observed mortality is higher than the expected benchmark.

## Non-Linear Binning Algorithm

An important part of the approach Napoli et al. (2017) took was to
modify the M-Score approach of looking at linear bins of the probability
of survival distribution, and make it non-linear. The {traumar} package
does this for you using Dr. Napoli’s method:

``` r

# Apply the nonlinear_bins function
results <- nonlinear_bins(data = data,
                         Ps_col = Ps,
                         outcome_col = survival,
                         divisor1 = 4,
                         divisor2 = 4,
                         threshold_1 = 0.9,
                         threshold_2 = 0.99)

## The RMM function

The RMM is sensitive to higher acuity patients, meaning that if a trauma
center struggles with these patients, it will be reflected in the RMM.
In contrast, the W-Score may mask declines in performance due to the
influence of lower acuity patients via the MTOS Distribution. The
{traumar} package automates RMM calculation as a single score using the
nonlinear binning method from Napoli et al. (2017). The `rmm()` and
`rm_bin_summary()` functions internally call `nonlinear_bins()` to
generate the non-linear binning process. The function uses a bootstrap
process with `n_samples` repetitions to simulate an RMM distribution and
estimate 95% confidence intervals. The RMM, along with corresponding
confidence intervals, are provided for the population in `data`, as
well.
