# traumar 1.2.3
- `probability_of_survival()` was updated to enhance code readability and
  leverage mathematical notation in the calculation of predicted survival
  probabilities. The function now aligns with the coefficients published in
  Norouzi et al. (2013) and Merchant et al. (2023). Consistent with Boyd et al.
  (1987), the function does not treat patients under 15 years of age differently
  and accounts for penetrating injuries similarly to other age groups. This
  update ensures a standardized approach to calculating survival probabilities
  for both blunt and penetrating traumas.

- From this release forward, all development of `traumar` will be done in the
  IDE Positron!

# traumar 1.2.2

- `rmm()`, `rm_bin_summary()`, and `nonlinear_bins()`: Updated the documentation
  for the threshold arguments along with the divisor arguments. These were
  updated along with the Details section of the `nonlinear_bins()` function
  documentation to provide a better explanation of the binning algorithm under
  the hood.

- `probability_of_survival()`: Updated the Return section documentation to be
  more accurate that the output is not a percentage, it is the predicted
  probability of survival on a scale from 0 to 1. A previous version of this
  function was multiplied by 100 to seem more like a percentage.


# traumar 1.2.1

- Within the `trauma_performance()` function, renamed the variable
  `predicted_prob_death` to `scale_factor` which is commensurate with the source
  literature.

- updated comments in `trauma_performance()` for `z_method` method of the
  `Z_score` to reflect the right text. 

- In `trauma_performance()`, completed the comment where the `scale_factor` is
  created so that it is complete and clear. 

- Corrected a test error at CRAN from using bootstrap CI process in testing with
  100,000 observations and 100 bootstrap samples to make sure `rmm()` and
  `rm_bin_summary()` ran in under 60 sec. That test now does not use the
  bootstrap process so the core function can be tested and will always run in
  under a minute with 100,000 observations. 

- Cleaned up other tests within for relative_mortality.R that were checking for
  correct error / warning handling where multiple lines of output were sent to
  the console. Built a custom function to deal with those scenarios and
  correctly perform those unit tests. 

# traumar 1.2.0

- This minor release introduces functionality to demonstrate how the Iowa trauma
  system currently engages in the quality improvement process using the System
  Evaluation and Quality Improvement Committee (SEQIC) Indicators.

- Added a [Contributor Code of
  Conduct](https://bemts-hhs.github.io/traumar/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html) and support
  information.

- Additionally, a convenience function `is_it_normal()` provides the ability for
  users of `traumar` to get descriptive statistics on one or more numeric
  variables, with optional normality tests, and diagnostic plots (for one
  variable only). Grouping functionality is also supported in `is_it_normal()`
  to conduct exploratory data analysis of one or more variables within zero or
  more groups. 

- Added the following functions:
  - `seqic_indicator_1()`
  - `seqic_indicator_2()`
  - `seqic_indicator_3()`
  - `seqic_indicator_4()`
  - `seqic_indicator_5()`
  - `seqic_indicator_6()`
  - `seqic_indicator_7()`
  - `seqic_indicator_8()`
  - `seqic_indicator_9()`
  - `seqic_indicator_10()`
  - `seqic_indicator_11()`
  - `seqic_indicator_12()`
  - `seqic_indicator_13()`
  - `is_it_normal()`
- A fix was applied to `nonlinear_bins()` to make the `percent` column calculate
  correctly when groups were not introduced.

- Removed hard-coded rounding from most calculations within the package where
  possible.

- Improved examples for the the package's README, `probability_of_survival()`,
  `nonlinear_bins()`, `rmm()`, and `rm_bin_summary()` using more helpful data.

- Improved error messages coming from `nonlinear_bins()` when the argument
  `Ps_col` does not follow the expected distribution of the calculated
  probability of survival, and/or a sample size too small to calculate bins is
  passed to the function, including when passed to `rmm()` and
  `rm_bin_summary()`.

- Code formatting changed to the `air` package through the RStudio IDE.
- Updated data validation for `trauma_case_mix()`, `trauma_performance()`,
  `nonlinear_bins()`, `rmm()`, and `rm_bin_summary()` to provide improved
  messaging related to missings in `Ps_col` and `outcome_col` .

- Across functions using the probability of survival calculation, it is expected
  that Ps values have a range of [0, 1].  Functions will no longer handle values
  in percentage format (e.g. 10, 50, 98).

- The `outcome` argument was removed from `trauma_performance()` to remove
  ambiguity in the nature of the `outcome_col` values. Only values of
  `TRUE/FALSE` and `1/0` are accepted.

- The `diagnostics` argument was removed from `trauma_performance()` to make the
  user interface smoother.  Instead of providing guidance via outputs to the
  console, users are encouraged to seek assistance with interpreting results via
  the source academic literature and the package documentation.

- `trauma_performance()` will no longer provide a pivoted output as a default.
  Users can elect to pivot the outputs as needed in their workflows.

- `rmm()` and `rm_bin_summary()` now have a new argument `bootstrap_ci` that
  allows a user to elect to use the bootstrap CIs, or not.  `bootstrap_ci`
  defaults to `TRUE` in order to better support backward compatibility.


# traumar 1.1.0

## New Features

- Added optional grouping functionality to `nonlinear_bins()`, `rmm()`, and
  `rm_bin_summary()`.
  
  - Setting `group_vars = NULL` applies the functions to the entire dataset
    without subgrouping.
    
  - For pivoting the `rmm()` outputs longer, setting `pivot = TRUE` will work
    when `group_vars` is invoked by pivoting longer with the grouping context.


## Enhancements

- Improved `NA` handling in `rmm()` and `rm_bin_summary()`.  

- Ensured RMM calculations remain within the expected range of [-1 to 1],
  including their 95% confidence intervals.   

- Optimized `nonlinear_bins()` by replacing its internal `for` loop with `dplyr`
  functions, enhancing accuracy and efficiency without introducing breaking
  changes. 

- Improved command line messaging and documentation within `rmm()` and
  `rm_bin_summary()` regarding probability of survival values `Ps_col < 0` and
  `Ps_col > 1`.  Now, these functions will throw an error if probability of
  survival values are `Ps_col < 0` or `Ps_col > 1`. 

- The `nonlinear_bins()` function has improved data validation for the `Ps_col`
  variable.
