#' Calculate Trauma Hospital Performance Based on Robust and Validated Measures
#'
#' This function calculates trauma hospital performance based on the M, W, and Z
#' scores, which are derived from survival probability and mortality data, using
#' established methods. It computes the W-score, M-score, and Z-score based on
#' the provided dataset and calculates performance metrics for trauma programs.
#' For more information on the methods used in this function, please see
#' Champion et al. (1990) on the W score, and Flora (1978) and Boyd et al.
#' (1987) on the M and Z scores.
#'
#' @param df A data frame containing patient data.
#' @param Ps_col The name of the column containing the probability of survival
#'   (Ps). The values should be numeric and between 0 and 1. Values greater than
#'   1 will be automatically converted to decimal format by dividing by 100.
#' @param outcome_col The name of the column containing the binary outcome data.
#'
#'   The column should contain binary values indicating the patient outcome.
#'   Valid values include 1 (dead) and 0 (alive), or TRUE (dead) and FALSE
#'   (alive), or other similar binary representations (e.g., "Yes" for dead and
#'   "No" for alive). The function will check for two unique values in this
#'   column and expects them to represent the outcome in a binary form.
#'
#' @param outcome The value representing mortality (default is 1). Can also be set
#'   to 0 or TRUE/FALSE, depending on how the outcome is encoded in
#'   `outcome_col`.
#' @param z_method A character vector indicating which method to use for
#'   calculating the Z-score. Must be one of "survival" or "mortality". The
#'   default is "survival".
#' @param diagnostics A logical flag (default is FALSE). If TRUE, diagnostic
#'   information about the W, M, and Z scores will be printed to the console.
#'
#' @return A tibble containing the following calculations:
#'
#' - `N_Patients`: The total number of patients included in the analysis.
#' - `N_Survivors`: The total number of patients who survived, based on the provided outcome data.
#' - `N_Deaths`: The total number of patients who died, based on the provided outcome data.
#' - `Predicted_Survivors`: The total predicted number of survivors based on the
#' survival probability (`Ps`) for all patients.
#' - `Predicted_Deaths`: The total predicted number of deaths, calculated as `1 - Ps` for all patients.
#' - `Patient_Estimate`: The estimated number of patients who survived, calculated based
#' on the W-score. This value reflects the difference between the actual and
#' predicted number of survivors.
#' - `W_Score`: The W-score, representing the difference between the observed and expected
#' number of survivors per 100 patients. A positive W-score indicates that more
#' patients survived than expected, while a negative score indicates that fewer
#' patients survived than expected.
#' - `M_Score`: The M-score, which compares the observed patient case mix to the Major Trauma
#' Outcomes Study (MTOS) case mix. A higher score indicates that the patient mix
#' is more similar to MTOS, while a lower score indicates a dissimilar mix. Based on the MTOS
#' literature, an M_Score >= 0.88 indicates that the Z_Score comes from distribution similar
#' enough to the MTOS Ps distribution.
#' - `Z_Score`: The Z-score, which quantifies the difference between the actual and predicted
#' mortality (if `z_method = "mortality"`) or survival (if `z_method =
#' "survival"`). A Z-score > 1.96 is considered to point to the statistical
#' significance of the W-Score at alpha = 0.05 level for survival. The positive
#' Z_Score indicates that more patients survived than predicted, while a
#' negative Z-score indicates fewer survivors than predicted.
