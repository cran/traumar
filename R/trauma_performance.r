#' @title Calculate Trauma Hospital Performance Based on Robust and Validated
#'   Measures
#'
#' @description
#'
#' This function calculates trauma hospital performance based on the M, W, and Z
#' scores, which are derived from survival probability and mortality data, using
#' established methods. It computes the W-score, M-score, and Z-score based on
#' the provided dataset and calculates performance metrics for trauma programs.
#' For more information on the methods used in this function, please see
#' Champion et al. (1990) on the W score, and Flora (1978) and Boyd et al.
#' (1987) on the M and Z scores.
#'
#' @param df A data frame containing patient data.
#' @param Ps_col The name of the column containing the probability of survival
#'   (Ps). The values should be numeric and between 0 and 1. Values greater than
#'   1 will be automatically converted to decimal format by dividing by 100.
#' @param outcome_col The name of the column containing the binary outcome data.
#'
#'   The column should contain binary values indicating the patient outcome.
#'   Valid values include 1 (dead) and 0 (alive), or TRUE (dead) and FALSE
#'   (alive). The function will check values in this column and expects them to
#'   represent the outcome in a binary form.
#'
#' @param z_method A character vector indicating which method to use for
#'   calculating the Z-score. Must be one of "survival" or "mortality". The
#'   default is "survival".
#'
#' @return A tibble containing the following calculations:
#' \itemize{
#' \item `N_Patients`: The total number of patients included in the analysis.
#' \item `N_Survivors`: The total number of patients who survived, based on the
#' provided outcome data.
#' \item `N_Deaths`: The total number of patients who died, based on the
#' provided outcome data.
#' \item `Predicted_Survivors`: The total predicted number of survivors based on
#' the survival probability (`Ps`) for all patients.
#' \item `Predicted_Deaths`: The total predicted number of deaths, calculated as
#' `1 - Ps` for all patients.
#' \item `Patient_Estimate`: The estimated number of patients who survived that
#' were predicted to die, calculated based on the W-score. This value reflects
#' the difference between the actual and predicted number of deceased patients.
#' \item `W_Score`: The W-score, representing the difference between the
#' observed and expected number of survivors per 100 patients. A positive
#' W-score indicates that more patients survived than expected, while a negative
#' score indicates that fewer patients survived than expected.
#' \item `M_Score`: The M-score, which compares the observed patient case mix to
#' the Major Trauma Outcomes Study (MTOS) case mix. A higher score indicates
#' that the patient mix is more similar to MTOS, while a lower score indicates a
#' dissimilar mix. Based on the MTOS literature, an M_Score >= 0.88 indicates
#' that the Z_Score comes from distribution similar enough to the MTOS Ps
#' distribution.
#' \item `Z_Score`: The Z-score, which quantifies the difference between the
#' actual and predicted mortality (if `z_method = "mortality"`) or survival (if
#' `z_method = "survival"`). A Z-score > 1.96 is considered to point to the
#' statistical significance of the W-Score at alpha = 0.05 level for survival.
#' The positive Z_Score indicates that more patients survived than predicted,
#' while a negative Z-score indicates fewer survivors than predicted.

#'
#' @details
#'
#' The function checks whether the `outcome_col` contains values representing a
#' binary outcome. It also ensures that `Ps_col` contains numeric values within
#' the range 0 to 1. If any values exceed 1, a warning is issued. The patients
#' are then grouped into predefined Ps ranges, and the function compares the
#' fraction of patients in each range with the MTOS case mix distribution.
#'
#' Like other statistical computing functions, `trauma_performance()` is
#' happiest without missing data.  It is best to pass complete probability of
#' survival and outcome data to the function for optimal performance. With
#' smaller datasets, this is especially helpful.  However,
#' `trauma_performance()` will throw a warning about missing values, if any
#' exist in `Ps_col` and/or `outcome_col`.
#'
#' @note
#'
#' This function will produce the most reliable and interpretable results when
#' using a dataset that has one row per patient, with each column being a
#' feature.
